# Metric Imperial Converter

Convert imperial measurements to the metric system and vice versa. This is a fullstack application making use of node and express on the back-end to make a simple HTTP server for request handling. Use the query parameters at the end of the url to convert measurements. Alternatively, make use of the front-end input box and convert button. jQuery makes ajax calls to the server, receives the converted measurements, and dynamically loads it to the page. Unit and function testing is done with the Chai and Mocha combination.

# Metric Imperial Converter

Convert imperial measurements to the metric system and vice versa. Use the query parameters at the end of the url to convert measurements. Alternatively, make use of the front-end input box and convert button. Node and Express are used on the back-end to implement an HTTP server for request handling. jQuery makes Ajax calls to the server, receives the converted measurements, and dynamically loads it to the page. Unit and function testing is done with the Chai and Mocha framework combination.
